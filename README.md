## Course content

Recent developments in quantum information systems and technologies offer the possibility to address some of the most challenging large-scale problems in science, whether they are represented by complicated interacting quantum mechanical systems or classical systems. The last years have seen a rapid and exciting development in algorithms and quantum hardware.   
The emphasis of this summer school is to highlight, through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises and practice sessions, how quantum computing algorithms can be used to study nuclear few- and many-body problems of relevance for low-energy nuclear physics.  And how quantum computing algorithms can aid in studying systems with increasingly many more degrees of freedom compared with more classical few- and many-body methods.  Several quantum algorithms for solving quantum-mechanical few- and many-particle problems with be discussed.  
The lectures will start with the basic ideas of quantum computing. Thereafter, through examples from nuclear physics, we will elucidate how different quantum algorithms can be used to study these systems. The results from various quantum computing algorithms will be compared to standard methods like full configuration interaction theory, field theories on the lattice, in-medium similarity renormalization group  and coupled cluster theories.
