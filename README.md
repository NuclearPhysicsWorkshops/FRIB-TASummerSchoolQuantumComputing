## Introduction and Motivation

Recent developments in quantum information systems and technologies
offer the possibility to address some of the most challenging
large-scale problems in science, whether they are represented by
complicated interacting quantum mechanical systems or classical
systems. The last years have seen a rapid and exciting development in
algorithms and quantum hardware.  The emphasis of this summer school
is to highlight, through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises
and practice sessions, how quantum computing algorithms can be used to
study nuclear few- and many-body problems of relevance for low-energy
nuclear physics.  And how quantum computing algorithms can aid in
studying systems with increasingly many more degrees of freedom
compared with more classical few- and many-body methods.  Several
quantum algorithms for solving quantum-mechanical few- and
many-particle problems with be discussed.  The lectures will start
with the basic ideas of quantum computing. Thereafter, through
examples from nuclear physics, we will elucidate how different quantum
algorithms can be used to study these systems. The results from
various quantum computing algorithms will be compared to standard
methods like full configuration interaction theory, field theories on
the lattice, in-medium similarity renormalization group and coupled
cluster theories.

## Detailed lecture plan 

Lectures are 50 minutes and there is a small break of 10 minutes
between each lecture. Longer breaks at 1030am-11am and 3pm-330pm.
In-person attendance is the main teaching modus, but lectures will be
broadcasted via zoom. The lectures will also be recorded and we will
offer breakout sessions via zoom for the hands-on sessions.
