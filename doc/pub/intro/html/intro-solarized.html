<h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>
<h2 id="software-and-needed-installations">Software and needed installations </h2>

<p>We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its
myriad of available libraries.  You will find
Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.  You can run <b>R</b>
codes in the Jupyter/IPython notebooks, with the immediate benefit of
visualizing your data. You can also use compiled languages like C++,
Rust, Julia, Fortran etc if you prefer. The focus in these lectures will be
on Python.
</p>

<p>If you have Python installed (we strongly recommend Python3) and you feel
pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that
you install the following Python packages via <b>pip</b> as 
</p>

<ol>
<li> pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow</li> 
</ol>
<p>For Python3, replace <b>pip</b> with <b>pip3</b>.</p>

<p>For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to
install <b>brew</b>. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional
software via for example 
</p>

<ol>
<li> brew install python3</li>
</ol>
<p>For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,
you can use <b>pip</b> as well and simply install Python as 
</p>

<ol>
<li> sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for pyhton2.7)</li>
</ol>
<p>etc etc. </p>
<h2 id="python-installers">Python installers </h2>

<p>If you don't want to perform these operations separately and venture
into the hassle of exploring how to set up dependencies and paths, we
recommend two widely used distrubutions which set up all relevant
dependencies for Python, namely 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>,</li> 
</ul>
<p>which is an open source
distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale
data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that
aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions
are managed by the package management system <b>conda</b>. 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" target="_blank">Enthought canopy</a></li> 
</ul>
<p>is a Python
distribution for scientific and analytic computing distribution and
analysis environment, available for free and under a commercial
license.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb" target="_blank">Google's Colab</a> is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires 
no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Try it out!
</p>
<h2 id="useful-python-libraries">Useful Python libraries </h2>
<p>Here we list several useful Python libraries we strongly recommend (if you use anaconda many of these are already there)</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a> is a highly popular library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays</li>
<li> <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">The pandas</a> library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools</li> 
<li> <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Xarray</a> is a Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank">Scipy</a> (pronounced &#8220;Sigh Pie&#8221;) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.</li> 
<li> <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a> is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd" target="_blank">Autograd</a> can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">SymPy</a> is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.</li> 
<li> <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a> has simple and efficient tools for machine learning, data mining and data analysis</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google</li>
<li> <a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">Keras</a> is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano</li>
<li> And many more such as <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">pytorch</a>,  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Theano/" target="_blank">Theano</a> etc</li> 
</ul>
<h2 id="installing-r-c-cython-or-julia">Installing R, C++, cython or Julia </h2>

<p>You will also find it convenient to utilize <b>R</b>. We will mainly
use Python during lectures and in various projects and exercises.
Those of you
already familiar with <b>R</b> should feel free to continue using <b>R</b>, keeping
however an eye on the parallel Python set ups. Similarly, if you are a
Python afecionado, feel free to explore <b>R</b> as well.  Jupyter/Ipython
notebook allows you to run <b>R</b> codes interactively in your
browser. The software library <b>R</b> is tuned to statistically analysis
and allows for an easy usage of the tools we will discuss in these
lectures.
</p>
