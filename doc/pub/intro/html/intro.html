<h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>

<p>Recent developments in quantum information systems and technologies
offer the possibility to address some of the most challenging
large-scale problems in science, whether they are represented by
complicated interacting quantum mechanical systems or classical
systems. The last years have seen a rapid and exciting development in
algorithms and quantum hardware.  The emphasis of this summer school
is to highlight, through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises
and practice sessions, how quantum computing algorithms can be used to
study nuclear few- and many-body problems of relevance for low-energy
nuclear physics.  And how quantum computing algorithms can aid in
studying systems with increasingly many more degrees of freedom
compared with more classical few- and many-body methods.  Several
quantum algorithms for solving quantum-mechanical few- and
many-particle problems with be discussed.  The lectures will start
with the basic ideas of quantum computing. Thereafter, through
examples from nuclear physics, we will elucidate how different quantum
algorithms can be used to study these systems. The results from
various quantum computing algorithms will be compared to standard
nuclear few- and many-body methods

<li> We strongly recommend using the Jupyter notebook environment at <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/" target="_blank"><tt>https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/</tt></a>. This environment has Qiskit already set up and is free,  just requires an email to register. It has built in support for Jupyter notebooks and should be sufficient for everything needed.</li>

<h2 id="detailed-lecture-plan">Detailed lecture plan  </h2>

<p>The duration of each lecture is approximately 45-50 minutes and there
is a small break of 10-15 minutes between each lecture. Longer breaks
at 1030am-11am and 3pm-330pm, except for Monday where there is also
the possibility fora guided FRIB tour.  In-person attendance is the
main teaching modus, but lectures and hands-on sessions will be
broadcasted via zoom for those who cannot attend in person. The zoom
link will be sent to those who have expressed that they cannot attend
in person. The lectures will also be recorded.

</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites </h2>

<p>You are expected to have operating programming skills in programming
languages like Python (preferred) and/or Fortran, C++, Julia or
similar and knowledge of quantum mechanics at an intermediate level
(senior undergraduate and/or beginning graduate). Knowledge of linear
algebra is essential.  Additional modules for self-teaching on Python
and quantum mechanics are also provided. 
</p>
<h2 id="software-and-needed-installations">Software and needed installations </h2>

<p>We will make extensive use of Python as programming language and its
myriad of available libraries.  You will find
Jupyter notebooks invaluable in your work.
</p>

<p>If you have Python installed (we strongly recommend Python3) and you feel
pretty familiar with installing different packages, we recommend that
you install the following Python packages via <b>pip</b> as 
</p>

<ol>
<li> pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn mglearn sympy pandas pillow</li> 
</ol>
<p>For Python3, replace <b>pip</b> with <b>pip3</b>.</p>

<p>For OSX users we recommend, after having installed Xcode, to
install <b>brew</b>. Brew allows for a seamless installation of additional
software via for example 
</p>

<ol>
<li> brew install python3</li>
</ol>
<p>For Linux users, with its variety of distributions like for example the widely popular Ubuntu distribution,
you can use <b>pip</b> as well and simply install Python as 
</p>

<ol>
<li> sudo apt-get install python3  (or python for pyhton2.7)</li>
</ol>
<p>etc etc. </p>
<h2 id="python-installers">Python installers </h2>

<p>If you don't want to perform these operations separately and venture
into the hassle of exploring how to set up dependencies and paths, we
recommend two widely used distrubutions which set up all relevant
dependencies for Python, namely 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>,</li> 
</ul>
<p>which is an open source
distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale
data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that
aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions
are managed by the package management system <b>conda</b>. 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/" target="_blank">Enthought canopy</a></li> 
</ul>
<p>is a Python
distribution for scientific and analytic computing distribution and
analysis environment, available for free and under a commercial
license.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb" target="_blank">Google's Colab</a> is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires 
no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Try it out!
</p>
<h2 id="useful-python-libraries">Useful Python libraries </h2>
<p>Here we list several useful Python libraries we strongly recommend (if you use anaconda many of these are already there)</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a> is a highly popular library for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays</li>
<li> <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">The pandas</a> library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools</li> 
<li> <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Xarray</a> is a Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank">Scipy</a> (pronounced &#8220;Sigh Pie&#8221;) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.</li> 
<li> <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a> is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd" target="_blank">Autograd</a> can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">SymPy</a> is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.</li> 
<li> <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a> has simple and efficient tools for machine learning, data mining and data analysis</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google</li>
<li> <a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">Keras</a> is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano</li>
<li> And many more such as <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">pytorch</a>,  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Theano/" target="_blank">Theano</a> etc</li> 
</ul>
<p>All learning material and teaching schedule pertinent to the course is
avaliable at this GitHub address. A simple <b>git clone</b> of the material
gives you access to all lecture notes and program examples. Similarly,
running a <b>git pull</b> gives you immediately the latest updates.
