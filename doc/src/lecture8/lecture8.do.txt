===== Classical many-body methods and quantum computing =====

Classical many-body methods in quantum mechanics often trade
computational complexity for accuracy when solving for the ground
state energy of a system. The recent advances in quantum computing
have shown promise in approximating the ground state energy without
such a large trade-off. In classical computing, the
basic unit of information is called a bit. The bit is represented by a
binary digit, either a 1 or a 0. A collection of bits provides a
binary string with information, and this information can be
manipulated with what we call logic gates. Logic gates are operations
on one or more bits and produce a single output, 1 or 0. A collection
of such logic gates is called a circuit and an example of such a
circuit could be outputting a 1 if all input bits are put to 1 and
output 0 otherwise. The behaviour of all circuits on classical
computers is deterministic in the sense that a given input binary
string will always produce the same output.

=====  Quantum computing =====

How quantum computing differs from classical computing can partly be
illustrated by looking at the surface of the unit Bloch sphere discussed in earlier lectures.

A classical bit must either be in the $\vert 0\rangle$ state
at the surface on the north pole, or in the $\vert 1\rangle$ state at the
surface on the south pole; the quantum bit, namely a qubit, can be in
a state located anywhere on the surface of the Block sphere. The qubit
state $\vert\psi\rangle$ can be in 
superposition,
!bt
\[
\vert\psi\rangle = c_0 \vert 0\rangle + c_1 \vert 1\rangle,
\]
!et
where a
measurement of the qubit will collapse the state, resulting in the
state $\vert 0\rangle$ or $\vert 1\rangle$ with probability $|c_0|^2$ or $|c_1|^2$
respectively. These coefficients are referred to as amplitudes and
could be any complex number as long as the measurement probabilities
are normalized, that is $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 = 1$.

===== Slater determinants as basis states, Fermionic problems =====

!bblock
The simplest possible choice for many-body wavefunctions are _product_ wavefunctions.
That is
!bt
\[ 
\Psi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_A) \approx \phi_1(x_1) \phi_2(x_2) \phi_3(x_3) \ldots
\]
!et
because we are really only good  at thinking about one particle at a time. Such 
product wavefunctions, without correlations, are easy to 
work with; for example, if the single-particle states $\phi_i(x)$ are orthonormal, then 
the product wavefunctions are easy to orthonormalize.   

Similarly, computing matrix elements of operators are relatively easy, because the 
integrals factorize.


The price we pay is the lack of correlations, which we must build up by using many, many product 
wavefunctions. (Thus we have a trade-off: compact representation of correlations but 
difficult integrals versus easy integrals but many states required.) 
!eblock

!split
===== Slater determinants as basis states, repetition =====
!bblock
Because we have fermions, we are required to have antisymmetric wavefunctions, e.g.
!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_A) = - \Psi(x_2, x_1, x_3, \ldots, x_A)
\]
!et
etc. This is accomplished formally by using the determinantal formalism
!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_A) 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{A!}} 
\det \left | 
\begin{array}{cccc}
\phi_1(x_1) & \phi_1(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_1(x_A) \\
\phi_2(x_1) & \phi_2(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_2(x_A) \\
 \vdots & & &  \\
\phi_A(x_1) & \phi_A(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_A(x_A) 
\end{array}
\right |
\]
!et
Product wavefunction + antisymmetry = Slater determinant.

===== Slater determinants as basis states =====

!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_A)

\begin{array}{cccc}
\phi_1(x_1) & \phi_1(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_1(x_A) \\
\phi_2(x_1) & \phi_2(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_2(x_A) \\
 \vdots & & &  \\
\phi_A(x_1) & \phi_A(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_A(x_A) 
\end{array}
\right |

Properties of the determinant (interchange of any two rows or 
any two columns yields a change in sign; thus no two rows and no 
two columns can be the same) lead to the Pauli principle:

* No two particles can be at the same place (two columns the same); and
* No two particles can be in the same state (two rows the same).

===== Slater determinants as basis states =====
!bblock
As a practical matter, however, Slater determinants beyond $N=4$ quickly become 
unwieldy. Thus we turn to the _occupation representation_ or _second quantization_ to simplify calculations. 

The occupation representation or number representation, using fermion _creation_ and _annihilation_ 
operators, is compact and efficient. It is also abstract and, at first encounter, not easy to 
internalize. It is inspired by other operator formalism, such as the ladder operators for 
the harmonic oscillator or for angular momentum, but unlike those cases, the operators _do not have coordinate space representations_.

Instead, one can think of fermion creation/annihilation operators as a game of symbols that 
compactly reproduces what one would do, albeit clumsily, with full coordinate-space Slater 
determinants. 
!eblock

!split
===== Reminder  on the occupation representation (second quantization) =====
!bblock
We start with a set of orthonormal single-particle states $\{ \phi_i(x) \}$. 
(Note: this requirement, and others, can be relaxed, but leads to a 
more involved formalism.) _Any_ orthonormal set will do. 

To each single-particle state $\phi_i(x)$ we associate a creation operator 
$\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ and an annihilation operator $\hat{a}_i$. 

When acting on the vacuum state $| 0 \rangle$, the creation operator $\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ causes 
a particle to occupy the single-particle state $\phi_i(x)$:
!bt
\[
\phi_i(x) \rightarrow \hat{a}^\dagger_i |0 \rangle
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Quick repetition  of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
But with multiple creation operators we can occupy multiple states:
!bt
\[
\phi_i(x) \phi_j(x^\prime) \phi_k(x^{\prime \prime}) 
\rightarrow \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k |0 \rangle.
\]
!et

Now we impose antisymmetry, by having the fermion operators satisfy  _anticommutation relations_:
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j + \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i
= [ \hat{a}^\dagger_i ,\hat{a}^\dagger_j ]_+ 
= \{ \hat{a}^\dagger_i ,\hat{a}^\dagger_j \} = 0
\]
!et
so that 
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j = - \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quick repetition  of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
Because of this property, automatically $\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_i = 0$, 
enforcing the Pauli exclusion principle.  Thus when writing a Slater determinant 
using creation operators, 
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \ldots |0 \rangle
\]
!et
each index $i,j,k, \ldots$ must be unique.

===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We have defined the ansatz for the ground state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_0\rangle = \left(\prod_{i\le F}\hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle,
\]
!et
where the index $i$ defines different single-particle states up to the Fermi level. We have assumed that we have $N$ fermions. 
A given one-particle-one-hole ($1p1h$) state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_i^a\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
while a $2p2h$ state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
and a general $NpNh$ state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ijk\dots}^{abc\dots}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{c}^{\dagger}\dots\hat{a}_k\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We can then expand our exact state function for the ground state 
as
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=C_0|\Phi_0\rangle+\sum_{ai}C_i^a|\Phi_i^a\rangle+\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle+\dots
=(C_0+\hat{C})|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the so-called correlation operator 
!bt
\[
\hat{C}=\sum_{ai}C_i^a\hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_i  +\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}\hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i+\dots
\]
!et
Since the normalization of $\Psi_0$ is at our disposal and since $C_0$ is by hypothesis non-zero, we may arbitrarily set $C_0=1$ with 
corresponding proportional changes in all other coefficients. Using this so-called intermediate normalization we have
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \langle \Phi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = 1, 
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=(1+\hat{C})|\Phi_0\rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We rewrite 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=C_0|\Phi_0\rangle+\sum_{ai}C_i^a|\Phi_i^a\rangle+\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle+\dots,
\]
!et
in a more compact form as 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=\sum_{PH}C_H^P\Phi_H^P=\left(\sum_{PH}C_H^P\hat{A}_H^P\right)|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where $H$ stands for $0,1,\dots,n$ hole states and $P$ for $0,1,\dots,n$ particle states. 
Our requirement of unit normalization gives
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2= 1,
\]
!et
and the energy can be written as 
!bt
\[
E= \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle= \sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}.

is solved by diagonalization setting up the Hamiltonian matrix defined by the basis of all possible Slater determinants. A diagonalization
# to do: add text about Rayleigh-Ritz
is equivalent to finding the variational minimum   of 
!bt
\[
 \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Phi_0 \rangle,
\]
!et
where $\lambda$ is a variational multiplier to be identified with the energy of the system.
The minimization process results in 
!bt
\[
\delta\left[ \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Phi_0 \rangle\right]=
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\left\{\delta[C_H^{*P}]\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}+
C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle \delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]-
\lambda( \delta[C_H^{*P}]C_{H'}^{P'}+C_H^{*P}\delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
Since the coefficients $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ and $\delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]$ are complex conjugates it is necessary and sufficient to require the quantities that multiply with $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ to vanish.

This leads to 
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda C_H^{P}=0,
\]
!et
for all sets of $P$ and $H$.

If we then multiply by the corresponding $C_H^{*P}$ and sum over $PH$ we obtain
!bt
\[ 
\sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda\sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2=0,
\]
!et
leading to the identification $\lambda = E$. This means that we have for all $PH$ sets
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{P'H'}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle = 0. label{eq:fullci}

An alternative way to derive the last equation is to start from 
!bt
\[
(\hat{H} -E)|\Psi_0\rangle = (\hat{H} -E)\sum_{P'H'}C_{H'}^{P'}|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle=0, 
\]
!et
and if this equation is successively projected against all $\Phi_H^P$ in the expansion of $\Psi$, then the last equation on the previous slide
results.   As stated previously, one solves this equation normally by diagonalization. If we are able to solve this equation exactly (that is
numerically exactly) in a large Hilbert space (it will be truncated in terms of the number of single-particle states included in the definition
of Slater determinants), it can then serve as a benchmark for other many-body methods which approximate the correlation operator
$\hat{C}$.

=====  Shell-model jargon =====
!bblock
If we do not make any truncations in the possible sets of Slater determinants (many-body states) we can make all possible configurations  by distributing $A$ nucleons among $n$ single-particle states, we call such a calculation for _Full configuration interaction theory_

If we make truncations, we have different possibilities

* The standard nuclear shell-model. Here we define an effective Hilbert space with respect to a given core. The calculations are normally then performed for all many-body states that can be constructed from the effective Hilbert spaces. This approach requires a properly defined effective Hamiltonian
* We can truncate in the number of excitations. For example, we can limit the possible Slater determinants to only $1p-1h$ and $2p-2h$ excitations. This is called a configuration interaction calculation at the level of singles and doubles excitations, or just CISD. 
* We can limit the number of excitations in terms of the excitation energies. If we do not define a core, this defines normally what is called the no-core shell-model approach.

=====  FCI and the exponential growth =====
!bblock
Full configuration interaction theory calculations provide in principle, if we can diagonalize numerically, all states of interest. The dimensionality of the problem explodes however quickly.

The total number of Slater determinants which can be built with say $N$ neutrons distributed among $n$ single particle states is
!bt
\[
\left (\begin{array}{c} n \\ N\end{array} \right) =\frac{n!}{(n-N)!N!}. 
\]
!et

For a model space which comprises the first for major shells only $0s$, $0p$, $1s0d$ and $1p0f$ we have $40$ single particle states for neutrons and protons.  For the eight neutrons of oxygen-16 we would then have
!bt
\[
\left (\begin{array}{c} 40 \\ 8\end{array} \right) =\frac{40!}{(32)!8!}\sim 10^{9}, 
\]
!et
and multiplying this with the number of proton Slater determinants we end up with approximately with a dimensionality $d$ of $d\sim 10^{18}$.
!eblock


!split
=====  Exponential wall =====
!bblock
This number can be reduced if we look at specific symmetries only. However, the dimensionality explodes quickly!

* For Hamiltonian matrices of dimensionalities  which are smaller than $d\sim 10^5$, we would use so-called direct methods for diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix
* For larger dimensionalities iterative eigenvalue solvers like Lanczos' method are used. The most efficient codes at present can handle matrices of $d\sim 10^{10}$.

At the end we can rewrite our solution of the Schroedinger equation in terms of $n$ coupled equations for the coefficients $C_H^P$.
This is a very cumbersome way of solving the equation. However, by using this iterative scheme we can illustrate how we can compute the
various terms in the wave operator or correlation operator $\hat{C}$. We will later identify the calculation of the various terms $C_H^P$
as parts of different many-body approximations to full CI. In particular, we can  relate this non-linear scheme with Coupled Cluster theory and
many-body perturbation theory.

===== Summarizing FCI and bringing in approximative methods =====
!bblock

If we can diagonalize large matrices, FCI is the method of choice since:
* It gives all eigenvalues, ground state and excited states
* The eigenvectors are obtained directly from the coefficients $C_H^P$ which result from the diagonalization
* We can compute easily expectation values of other operators, as well as transition probabilities
* Correlations are easy to understand in terms of contributions to a given operator beyond the Hartree-Fock contribution. This is the standard approach in  many-body theory.

However, as we have seen, even for a small case like the four first major shells and a nucleus like oxygen-16, the dimensionality becomes quickly intractable. If we wish to include single-particle states that reflect weakly bound systems, we need a much larger single-particle basis. We need thus approximative methods that sum specific correlations to infinite order.

===== Pairing model single-particle basis states  =====
!bblock
We will as a model for studies of quantum computing algorithms use the nuclear pairing model.
In order to define the problem, we need first to define a single-particle space.
A simple space is the $(1/2)^2$ space with four single-particle states, using the quantum numbers
$(n,l,s,m_s)$:
 
* Single-particle state 1:   $n=0$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=-1/2$
* Single-particle state 2:   $n=0$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=1/2$
* Single-particle state 3:   $n=1$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=-1/2$
* Single-particle state 4:   $n=1$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=1/2$


For $N=2$ there are 4 two-particle states with total spin project $M=0$. Two of these correspond to no broken pairs.

!eblock

Another, slightly more challenging space is the $(1/2)^4$ space, that is, 
with eight  single-particle states we have

* Single-particle state 1:   $n=0$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=-1/2$
* Single-particle state 2:   $n=0$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=1/2$
* Single-particle state 3:   $n=1$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=-1/2$
* Single-particle state 4:   $n=1$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=1/2$
* Single-particle state 5:   $n=2$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=-1/2$
* Single-particle state 6:   $n=2$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=1/2$
* Single-particle state 7:   $n=3$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=-1/2$
* Single-particle state 8:   $n=3$ ,      $l=0$ ,     $s=1/2$ ,    $m_s=1/2$

In a nuclear  shell-model context we can interpret this as 4 $s_{1/2}$ levels, with $m = \pm 1/2$, we can also think of these as four pairs if don't break any pairs,  $\pm k, k = 1,2,3,4$. For a more realistic nuclear physics shell-model case, we 
assign single-particle energies,  depending on the radial quantum number $n$, that is, 
$\epsilon_k = |k| \delta$ so that they are equally spaced.

For application in the pairing model we can go further and consider only states with 
no ``broken pairs,'' that is, if $+k$ is filled (or $m = +1/2$, so is $-k$ ($m=-1/2$). 
If you want, you can write your code to accept only these, and obtain the following 
six states:

* $|           1,           2 ,          3         ,       4  \rangle , $

* $|            1      ,     2        ,        5         ,       6 \rangle , $

* $|            1         ,       2     ,           7         ,       8  \rangle , $

* $|            3        ,        4      ,          5          ,      6  \rangle , $

* $|            3        ,        4      ,          7         ,       8  \rangle , $

===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====
!bblock

We consider a space with $2\Omega$ single-particle states, with each 
state labeled by 
$k = 1, 2, 3, \Omega$ and $m = \pm 1/2$. The convention is that 
the state with $k>0$ has $m = + 1/2$ while $-k$ has $m = -1/2$.


The Hamiltonian we consider is 
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = -G \hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_-,
\]
!et
where
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_+ = \sum_{k > 0} \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_{-{k}}.
\]
!et
and $\hat{P}_- = ( \hat{P}_+)^\dagger$.

This problem can be solved using what is called the quasi-spin formalism to obtain the 
exact results. Thereafter we will try again using the explicit Slater determinant formalism.
!eblock

===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====
!bblock

One can show that
!bt
\[
\left [ \hat{P}_+, \hat{P}_- \right ] = \sum_{k> 0} \left( \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}_k 
+ \hat{a}^\dagger_{-{k}} \hat{a}_{-{k}} - 1 \right) = \hat{N} - \Omega.
\]
!et
Now define 
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_z = \frac{1}{2} ( \hat{N} -\Omega).
\]
!et
Finally you can show
!bt
\[
\left [ \hat{P}_z , \hat{P}_\pm \right ] = \pm \hat{P}_\pm.
\]
!et
This means the operators $\hat{P}_\pm, \hat{P}_z$ form a so-called  $SU(2)$ algebra, and we can 
use all our insights about angular momentum, even though there is no actual 
angular momentum involved.

So we rewrite the Hamiltonian to make this explicit:
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = -G \hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_- 
= -G \left( \hat{P}^2 - \hat{P}_z^2 + \hat{P}_z\right)
\]
!et

===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====
!bblock

Because of the SU(2) algebra, we know that the eigenvalues of 
$\hat{P}^2$ must be of the form $p(p+1)$, with $p$ either integer or half-integer, and the eigenvalues of $\hat{P}_z$ 
are $m_p$ with $p \geq | m_p|$, with $m_p$ also integer or half-integer. 


But because $\hat{P}_z = (1/2)(\hat{N}-\Omega)$, we know that for $N$ particles 
the value $m_p = (N-\Omega)/2$. Furthermore, the values of $m_p$ range from 
$-\Omega/2$ (for $N=0$) to $+\Omega/2$ (for $N=2\Omega$, with all states filled). 

We deduce the maximal $p = \Omega/2$ and for a given $n$ the 
values range of $p$ range from $|N-\Omega|/2$ to $\Omega/2$ in steps of 1 
(for an even number of particles) 


Following Racah we introduce the notation
$p = (\Omega - v)/2$
where $v = 0, 2, 4,..., \Omega - |N-\Omega|$ 
With this it is easy to deduce that the eigenvalues of the pairing Hamiltonian are
!bt
\[
-G(N-v)(2\Omega +2-N-v)/4
\]
!et
This also works for $N$ odd, with $v= 1,3,5, \dots$.

\[
\hat{P}^\dagger = \sum_{n} \hat{a}^\dagger_{n, m=+1/2} \hat{a}^\dagger_{n, m=-1/2}

 -G & 0 & -G & -G & 8\delta-2G & -G \\
0 & -G & -G & -G & -G & 10\delta -2G

(You should check by hand that this is correct.) 

For $\delta = 0$ we have the closed form solution of  the g.s. energy given by $-6G$.

===== Coupled cluster theory =====


The coupled cluster method is an efficient tool to compute atomic
nuclei with an effort that grows polynomial with system size. While
this might still be expensive, it is now possible to compute nuclei
with mass numbers about $A > 200$ with this method. Recall that
full configuration interaction (FCI) such as the no-core shell model
exhibits an exponential cost and is therefore limited to light nuclei.



======= The normal-ordered Hamiltonian =======

We start from the reference state

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{HFref}
\vert\Phi_0\rangle = \prod_{i=1}^A a^\dagger_i \vert 0\rangle 
\end{equation}
!et

for the description of a nucleus with mass number $A$.  Usually, this
reference is the Hartree-Fock state, but that is not necessary. In the
shell-model picture, it could also be a product state where the lowest
$A$ harmonic oscillator states are occupied.  Here and in what
follows, the indices $i,j,k,\ldots$ run over hole states,
i.e. orbitals occupied in the reference state (ref{HFref}), while
$a,b,c,\ldots$ run over particle states, i.e. unoccupied
orbitals. Indices $p,q,r,s$ can identify any orbital.  Let $n_u$ be
the number of unoccupied states, and $A$ is of course the number of
occupied states. We consider the Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Ham} H =
\sum_{pq} \varepsilon^p_q a^\dagger_p a_q +
\frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle pq\vert V\vert rs\rangle
a^\dagger_pa^\dagger_q a_sa_r
\end{equation}
!et



The reference state (ref{HFref}) is a non-trivial vacuum of our theory. 
We normal order this Hamiltonian with respect to the nontrivial vacuum
state given by the Hartree-Fock reference and obtain the
normal-ordered Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{HN}
H_N = \sum_{pq} f_{pq} \left\{a^\dagger_p a_q\right\} + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle pq\vert V\vert rs\rangle \left\{a^\dagger_pa^\dagger_q a_sa_r\right\}.
\end{equation}
!et

Here,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Fock}
f^p_q = \varepsilon^p_q + \sum_i \langle pi\vert V\vert qi\rangle
\end{equation}
!et

is the Fock matrix. We note that the Fock matrix is diagonal in the
Hartree-Fock basis. The brackets $\{\cdots\}$ in Eq. (ref{HN}) denote
normal ordering, i.e. all operators that annihilate the nontrivial
vaccum (ref{HFref}) are to the right of those operators that create
with respect to that vaccum. Normal ordering implies that $\langle
\Phi_0\vert H_N\vert \Phi_0\rangle = 0$.

We have to move all operators that annihilate the reference state to the right of those that create on the reference state. Thus,

The coupled-cluster method is a very efficient tool to compute nuclei
when a ``good'' reference state is available. Let us assume that the
reference state results from a Hartree-Fock calculation.

===== Exercise: What does ``good'' mean? =====
label{ex-2}

How do you know whether a Hartree-Fock state is a ``good'' reference?
Which results of the Hartree-Fock computation will inform you?

!bans

Once the Hartree-Fock equations are solved, the Fock matrix
(ref{Fock}) becomes diagonal, and its diagonal elements can be viewed
as single-particle energies. Hopefully, there is a clear gap in the
single-particle spectrum at the Fermi surface, i.e. after $A$ orbitals
are filled.

!eans


If symmetry-restricted Hartree-Fock is used, one is limited to compute
nuclei with closed subshells for neutrons and for protons. On a first
view, this might seem as a severe limitation. But is it? 



!split
===== Exercise: How many nuclei are accessible with the coupled cluster method based on spherical mean fields? =====
label{ex-3}
If one limits oneself to nuclei with mass number up to
mass number $A=60$, how many nuclei can potentially be described with
the coupled-cluster method? Which of these nuclei are potentially
interesting? Why?

!bans

Nuclear shell closures are at $N,Z=2,8,20,28,50,82,126$, and subshell
closures at $N,Z=2,6,8,14,16,20,28,32,34,40,50,\ldots$. 

In the physics of nuclei, the evolution of nuclear structure as
neutrons are added (or removed) from an isotope is a key
#interest. Examples are the rare isotopes of helium ($^{8,10}$ He)
#oxygen ($^{22,24,28}$ O), calcium ($^{52,54,60}$ Ca), nickel ($^{78}$
#Ni) and tin ($^{100,132}$ Sn). The coupled-cluster method has the
interest. Examples are the rare isotopes of helium (He-8,10)
oxygen (O-22,24,28), calcium (Ca-52,54,60), nickel (Ni-78) and tin
(Sn-100,132). The coupled-cluster method has the
potential to address questions regarding these nuclei, and in a
several cases was used to make predictions before experimental data
was available. In addition, the method can be used to compute
neighbors of nuclei with closed subshells.

!split
======= The similarity transformed Hamiltonian =======


There are several ways to view and understand the coupled-cluster
method. A first simple view of coupled cluster theory is that the
method induces correlations into the reference state by expressing a
correlated state as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{psi}
\vert\Psi\rangle = e^T \vert\Phi_0\rangle ,
\end{equation}
!et

Here, $T$ is an operator that induces correlations. We can now demand
that the correlate state (ref{psi}) becomes and eigenstate of the
Hamiltonian $H_N$, i.e.  $H_N\vert \Psi\rangle = E\vert \Psi\rangle$. This view,
while correct, is not the most productive one.  Instead, we
left-multiply the Schroedinger equation with $e^{-T}$ and find

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Schroedinger}
\overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle = E_c \vert \Phi_0\rangle . 
\end{equation}
!et

Here, $E_c$ is the correlation energy, and the total energy is
$E=E_c+E_{HF}$.  The similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is defined as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Hsim}
\overline{H_N} \equiv e^{-T} H_N e^T .
\end{equation}
!et


A more productive view on coupled-cluster theory thus emerges: This
method seeks a similarity transformation such that the uncorrelated
reference state (ref{HFref}) becomes an exact eigenstate of the
similarity-transformed Hamiltonian (ref{Hsim}).

!split
===== Exercise: What $T$ leads to Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$ ? =====
label{ex-4}
What are the conditions on $T$ such that $\overline{H_N}$ is Hermitian?

!bans

For a Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$, we need a unitary $e^T$, i.e. an
anti-Hermitian $T$ with $T = -T^\dagger$

!eans

As we will see below, coupled cluster theory employs a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
Replacing ordinary coupled cluster theory with the unitary coupled cluster approach, gives a many-body which is hermitian and obeys the variational principle.

!split
===== Exercise: Understanding (non-unitary) similarity transformations =====
label{ex-5}
Show that $\overline{H_N}$ has the same eigenvalues as $H_N$ for
arbitrary $T$. What is the spectral decomposition of a non-Hermitian
$\overline{H_N}$ ?

!bans

Let $H_N\vert E\rangle = E\vert E\rangle$. Thus

!bt
\begin{align*}
H_N e^{T} e^{-T} \vert E\rangle &= E\vert E\rangle , \\
\left(e^{-T} H_N e^T\right) e^{-T} \vert E\rangle &= Ee^{-T} \vert E\rangle , \\
\overline{H_N} e^{-T} \vert E\rangle &= E e^{-T}\vert E\rangle .
\end{align*}
!et

Thus, if $\vert E\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H_N$ with eigenvalue $E$,
then $e^{-T}\vert E\rangle$ is eigenstate of $\overline{H_N}$ with the same
eigenvalue.

A non-Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$ has eigenvalues $E_\alpha$
corresponding to left $\langle L_\alpha\vert $ and right $\vert R_\alpha
\rangle$ eigenstates. Thus

!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H_N} = \sum_\alpha \vert R_\alpha\rangle E_\alpha \langle L_\alpha \vert 
\end{align}
!et
with bi-orthonormal $\langle L_\alpha\vert R_\beta\rangle = \delta_\alpha^\beta$. 

!eans

!split
=====  Cluster operators =====
To make progress, we have to specify the cluster operator $T$. In
coupled cluster theory, this operator is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Top}
T \equiv \sum_{ia} t_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}t_{ij}^{ab}
a^\dagger_aa^\dagger_ba_ja_i + \cdots
+ \frac{1}{(A!)^2}\sum_{i_1\ldots i_A a_1 \ldots a_A}
t_{i_1\ldots i_A}^{a_1\ldots a_A} a^\dagger_{a_1}\cdots a^\dagger_{a_A} a_{i_A}\cdots a_{i_1} .
\end{equation}
!et


Thus, the operator (ref{Top}) induces particle-hole (p-h)
excitations with respect to the reference. In general, $T$ generates
up to $Ap-Ah$ excitations, and the unknown parameters are the cluster amplitides
$t_i^a$, $t_{ij}^{ab}$, ..., $t_{i_1,\ldots,i_A}^{a_1,\ldots,a_A}$.

!split
===== Exercise: How many unknowns? =====
label{ex-6}
Show that the number of unknowns is as large as the FCI dimension of
the problem, using the numbers $A$ and $n_u$.

!bans

We have to sum up all $np-nh$ excitations, and there are
$\binom{n_u}{n}$ particle states and $\binom{A}{A-n}$ hole states for
each $n$. Thus, we have for the total number

!bt
\begin{align}
\sum_{n=0}^A \binom{n_u}{n} \binom{A}{A-n}= \binom{A+n_u}{A} .
\end{align}
!et

The right hand side are obviously all ways to distribute $A$ fermions over $n_0+A$ orbitals.
!eans

!split
===== Approximations =====
Thus, the coupled-cluster method with the full cluster operator
(ref{Top}) is exponentially expensive, just as FCI. To make progress,
we need to make an approximation by truncating the operator. Here, we
will use the CCSD (coupled clusters singles doubles) approximation,
where

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Tccsd}
T \equiv \sum_{ia} t_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}t_{ij}^{ab}
a^\dagger_aa^\dagger_ba_ja_i .
\end{equation}
!et

We need to determine the unknown cluster amplitudes that enter in CCSD. Let

!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Phi_i^a\rangle &= a^\dagger_a a_i \vert \Phi_0\rangle , \\
\vert\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle &= a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_j a_i \vert \Phi_0\rangle
\end{align}
!et

be 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations of the reference. Computing matrix
elements of the Schroedinger Equation (ref{Schroedinger}) yields

!bt
\begin{align}
\label{ccsd}
\langle \Phi_0\vert \overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle &= E_c , \\
\langle \Phi_i^a\vert \overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle &= 0 , \\
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab}\vert \overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle &= 0 .
\end{align}
!et


!split
===== Structure of equations =====

The first equation states that the coupled-cluster correlation energy
is an expectation value of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. The
second and third equations state that the similarity-transformed
Hamiltonian exhibits no 1p-1h and no 2p-2h excitations. These
equations have to be solved to find the unknown amplitudes $t_i^a$ and
$t_{ij}^{ab}$. Then one can use these amplitudes and compute the
correlation energy from the first line of Eq. (ref{ccsd}).

We note that in the CCSD approximation the reference state is not an
exact eigenstates. Rather, it is decoupled from simple states but
$\overline{H}$ still connects this state to 3p-3h, and 4p-4h states
etc.

At this point, it is important to recall that we assumed starting from
a ``good'' reference state. In such a case, we might reasonably expect
that the inclusion of 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations could result in an
accurate approximation. Indeed, empirically one finds that CCSD
accounts for about 90% of the corelation energy, i.e. of the
difference between the exact energy and the Hartree-Fock energy. The
inclusion of triples (3p-3h excitations) typically yields 99% of the
correlation energy.

We see that the coupled-cluster method in its CCSD approximation
yields a similarity-transformed Hamiltonian that is of a two-body
structure with respect to a non-trivial vacuum. When viewed in this
light, the coupled-cluster method ``transforms'' an $A$-body problem
(in CCSD) into a two-body problem, albeit with respect to a nontrivial
vacuum.


!split
===== Exercise: Why is CCD not exact? =====
label{ex-6b}
Above we argued that a similarity transformation preserves all eigenvalues. Nevertheless, the CCD correlation energy is not the exact correlation energy. Explain!


!bans

The CCD approximation does not make $\vert\Phi_0\rangle$ an exact
eigenstate of $\overline{H_N}$; it is only an eigenstate when the
similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is truncated to at most 2p-2h
states. The full $\overline{H_N}$, with $T=T_2$, would involve
six-body terms (do you understand this?), and this full Hamiltonian
would reproduce the exact correlation energy. Thus CCD is a similarity
transformation plus a truncation, which decouples the ground state only
from 2p-2h states.

!eans

!split
======= Computing the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian =======

The solution of the CCSD equations, i.e. the second and third line of
Eq. (ref{ccsd}), and the computation of the correlation energy
requires us to compute matrix elements of the similarity-transformed
Hamiltonian (ref{Hsim}). This can be done with the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion

!bt
\begin{align}
\label{BCH}
\overline{H_N} &= e^{-T} H_N e^T \\
&=H_N + \left[ H_N, T\right]+ \frac{1}{2!}\left[ \left[ H_N, T\right], T\right]
+ \frac{1}{3!}\left[\left[ \left[ H_N, T\right], T\right], T\right] +\ldots .
\end{align}
!et

We now come to a key element of coupled-cluster theory: the cluster
operator (ref{Top}) consists of sums of terms that consist of particle
creation and hole annihilation operators (but no particle annihilation
or hole creation operators). Thus, all terms that enter $T$ commute
with each other. This means that the commutators in the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion (ref{BCH}) can only be non-zero
because each $T$ must connect to $H_N$ (but no $T$ with another
$T$). Thus, the expansion is finite.

===== Exercise: When does CCSD truncate? =====
label{ex-7}
In CCSD and for two-body Hamiltonians, how many nested
commutators yield nonzero results? Where does the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion terminate? What is the (many-body) rank of the resulting $\overline{H_N}$? 

!bans

CCSD truncates for two-body operators at four-fold nested commutators,
because each of the four annihilation and creation operators in
$\overline{H_N}$ can be knocked out with one term of $T$.

!eans

!split
===== Non-hermiticity =====

We see that the (disadvantage of having a) non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
$\overline{H_N}$ leads to the advantage that the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is finite, thus leading to the
possibility to compute $\overline{H_N}$ exactly. In contrast, the
IMSRG deals with a Hermitian Hamiltonian throughout, and the infinite
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is truncated at a high order when
terms become very small.

We write the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian as

!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H_N}=\sum_{pq} \overline{H}^p_q a^\dagger_q a_p + {1\over 4} \sum_{pqrs} \overline{H}^{pq}_{rs} a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_s a_r + \ldots
\end{align}
!et
with
!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H}^p_q &\equiv \langle p\vert \overline{H_N}\vert q\rangle , \\
\overline{H}^{pq}_{rs} &\equiv \langle pq\vert \overline{H_N}\vert rs\rangle .
\end{align}
!et

Thus, the CCSD Eqs.~(ref{ccsd}) for the amplitudes can be written as
$\overline{H}_i^a = 0$ and $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}=0$.

!split
===== Exercise: Compute the matrix element $\overline{H}_{ab}^{ij}\equiv \langle ij\vert \overline{H_N}\vert ab\rangle$ =====
label{ex-8}


!bans

This is a simple task. This matrix element is part of the operator
$\overline{H}_{ab}^{ij}a^\dagger_ia^\dagger_ja_ba_a$, i.e. particles
are annihilated and holes are created. Thus, no contraction of the
Hamiltonian $H$ with any cluster operator $T$ (remember that $T$
annihilates holes and creates particles) can happen, and we simply
have $\overline{H}_{ab}^{ij} = \langle ij\vert V\vert ab\rangle$.

!eans


We need to work out the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian of
Eq. (ref{BCH}). To do this, we write $T=T_1 +T_2$ and $H_N= F +V$,
where $T_1$ and $F$ are one-body operators, and $T_2$ and $V$ are
two-body operators.

!split
===== Example: The contribution of $[F, T_2]$ to $\overline{H_N}$ =====
label{ex-9}

The commutator $[F, T_2]$ consists of two-body and one-body terms. Let
us compute first the two-body term, as it results from a single
contraction (i.e. a single application of $[a_p, a^\dagger_q] =
\delta_p^q$). We denote this as $[F, T_2]_{2b}$ and find

!bt
\begin{align*}
[F, T_2]_{2b} &= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{rsuv} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\left[a^\dagger_q a_p, a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_j a_i \right]_{2b} \\
&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_p^a a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_p^b a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_a a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_q^j a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  \\
&+ \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pq}\sum_{abij} f_p^q t_{ij}^{ab}\delta_q^i a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_j  \\
&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{qbij}\left(\sum_{a} f_a^q t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{qaij}\left(\sum_{b} f_b^q t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_a a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pabi}\left(\sum_{j} f_p^j t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  \\
&+ \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pabj}\left(\sum_{i} f_p^i t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_j  \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{qbij}\left(\sum_{a} f_a^q t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{2}\sum_{pabi}\left(\sum_{j} f_p^j t_{ij}^{ab}\right)a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  .
\end{align*}
!et

Here we exploited the antisymmetry $t_{ij}^{ab} = -t_{ji}^{ab} =
-t_{ij}^{ba} = t_{ji}^{ba}$ in the last step. Using $a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i = -a^\dagger_b a^\dagger_q a_j a_i $ and $a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i = a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_i a_p$, we can make the expression 
manifest antisymmetric, i.e.

!bt
\begin{align*}
[F, T_2]_{2b}
&= \frac{1}{4}\sum_{qbij}\left[\sum_{a} \left(f_a^q t_{ij}^{ab}-f_a^b t_{ij}^{qa}\right)\right]a^\dagger_q a^\dagger_b a_j a_i  \\
&- \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pabi}\left[\sum_{j} \left(f_p^j t_{ij}^{ab}-f_i^j t_{pj}^{ab}\right)\right]a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_p a_i  .
\end{align*}
!et
Thus, the contribution of $[F, T_2]_{2b}$ to the matrix element $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$ is  
!bt
\begin{align*}
\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab} \leftarrow  \sum_{c} \left(f_c^a t_{ij}^{cb}-f_c^b t_{ij}^{ac}\right) - \sum_{k} \left(f_j^k t_{ik}^{ab}-f_i^k t_{jk}^{ab}\right)
\end{align*}
!et

Here we used an arrow to indicate that this is just one contribution
to this matrix element.  We see that the derivation straight forward,
but somewhat tedious. As no one likes to commute too much (neither in
this example nor when going to and from work), and so we need a better
approach. This is where diagramms come in handy.



!split
===== CCD Approximation =====

In what follows, we will consider the coupled cluster doubles (CCD)
approximation. This approximation is valid in cases where the system
cannot exhibit any particle-hole excitations (such as nuclear matter
when formulated on a momentum-space grid) or for the pairing model (as
the pairing interactions only excites pairs of particles). In this
case $t_i^a=0$ for all $i, a$, and $\overline{H}_i^a=0$. The CCD
approximation is also of some sort of leading order approximation in
the Hartree-Fock basis (as the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian exhibits no
particle-hole excitations).


!split
===== Exercise: Derive the CCD equations! =====

Let us consider the matrix element $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$. Clearly,
it consists of all diagrams (i.e. all combinations of $T_2$, and a

Let us now turn to the computational cost of a CCD computation.

!split
===== Exercise: Computational scaling of CCD =====
label{ex-13}
For each of the contributions of the CCD ansatz write down the
computational cost in terms of the number of occupied $A$ and the
number of unoccupied $n_u$ orbitals.

!bans
The cost is $A^2 n_u^2$, $A^2 n_u^3$, $A^3 n_u^2$,
$A^2 n_u^4$, $A^4 n_u^2$, $A^3 n_u^3$,
$A^4 n_u^4$, $A^4 n_u^4$,
$A^4 n_u^4$, and $A^4 n_u^4$ for the respective diagrams.
!eans


!split
===== Computational costs =====
Note that $n_u\gg A$ in general. In textbooks, one reads that CCD (and
CCSD) cost only $A^2n_u^4$. Our most expensive diagrams, however are
$A^4n_u^4$. What is going on?

To understand this puzzle, let us consider the most expensive 2p-2h contribution. We break up the computation into two steps,
computing first the intermediate
!bt
\begin{align}
\chi_{ij}^{kl}\equiv {1\over 2} \sum_{cd} \langle kl\vert V\vert cd\rangle t_{ij}^{cd}
\end{align}
!et
at a cost of $A^4n_u^2$, and then 
!bt
\begin{align}
{1\over 2} \sum_{kl} \chi_{ij}^{kl} t_{kl}^{ab}  
\end{align}
!et
at a cost of $A^4n_u^2$. This is affordable. The price to pay is the
storage of the intermediate $\chi_{ij}^{kl}$, i.e. we traded
memory for computational cycles. This trick is known as
``factorization.'' 


!split
===== Solving the CCD equations =====

The CCD equations are nonlinear in the
cluster amplitudes. How do we solve $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}=0$? We
subtract $(f_a^a +f_b^b -f_i^i -f_j^j)t_{ij}^{ab}$ from both sides of
$\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}=0$ (because this term is contained in
$\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$) and find

!bt
\begin{align*}
(f_i^i +f_j^j -f_a^a -f_b^b)t_{ij}^{ab} &= (f_i^i +f_j^j -f_a^a -f_b^b)t_{ij}^{ab} +\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}
\end{align*}
!et

Dividing by $(f_i^i +f_j^j -f_a^a -f_b^b)$ yields
!bt
\begin{align}
t_{ij}^{ab} &= t_{ij}^{ab} + \frac{\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}}{f_i^i +f_j^j -f_a^a -f_b^b}
\label{iter}
\end{align}
!et

This equation is of the type $t=f(t)$, and we solve it by iteration,
i.e. we start with a guess $t_0$ and iterate $t_{n+1}=f(t_n)$, and
hope that this will converge to a solution. We take the perturbative result
!bt
\begin{align}
\label{pert}
\left(t_{ij}^{ab}\right)_0 = \frac{\langle ab\vert V\vert ij\rangle}{f_i^i +f_j^j -f_a^a -f_b^b}
\end{align}
!et

as a starting point, compute $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$, and find a new
$t_{ij}^{ab}$ from the right-hand side of Eq. (ref{iter}). We repeat
this process until the amplitudes (or the CCD energy) converge.


!split
===== CCD for the pairing Hamiltonian =====


You learned about the pairing Hamiltonian earlier in this
school. Convince yourself that this Hamiltonian does not induce any
1p-1h excitations. We can then solve the CCD equations for this
problem. This consists of the following steps

o Write a function that compute the potential, i.e. it returns a four-indexed array (or tensor). We need $\langle ab\vert V\vert cd\rangle$, $\langle ij\vert V\vert kl\rangle$, and $\langle ab\vert V\vert ij\rangle$. Why is there no $\langle ab\vert V\vert id\rangle$ or $\langle ai\vert V\vert jb\rangle$ ?

o Write a function that computes the Fock matrix, i.e. a two-indexed array. We only need $f_a^b$ and $f_i^j$. Why? 

o Initialize the cluster amplitudes according to Eq. (ref{pert}), and solve Eq. (ref{iter}) by iteration. The cluster amplitudes $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two- and four-indexed arrays, respectively.

Please note that the contraction of tensors (i.e. the summation over
common indices in products of tensors) is very user friendly and
elegant in python when `numpy.einsum` is used.
